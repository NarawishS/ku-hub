# KU-Hub
[project ISP 2020]()<br>

## Description

KU Hub is a webboard site for KU students to share opinions or 
perspectives on things in Kasetsart University. By using the features 
of commenting and posting in our application as the medium for 
communication, the students will be able to communicate and convey their 
message to each other way easier than using a normal board along places. 
It helps students know what other students want to tell the world. 
Moreover, the discussion will be useful for our ideas improvement due to 
the fact that it gives us many ways of thinking. 

To sign in KU Hub, KU email is required to determine the user identities.
